# Medium - Scheduled Stories
A chrome extension that alerts the user whether a story is scheduled for publication. It's always nice to know whether that big publication has already queued your masterpiece, or that it's still to be reviewed

## Features
- If a story is scheduled (either in a publication or by yourself), it is shown when it is scheduled on the Edit-page

## Know issues
- Sometimes the title-area of the story shifts down a bit. A simple resize of the window will fix this.
## Version history
- 1.0 Launch!
